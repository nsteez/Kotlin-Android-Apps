# Android Project 3 - *MovieFlix*

Submitted by: **Netti**

**MovieFlix** is a movie browsing app that allows users to browse movies currently playing in theaters.

Time spent: **5** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [X] **Make a request to [The Movie Database API's `now_playing`](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/movies/get-now-playing) endpoint to get a list of current movies**
- [X] **Parse through JSON data and implement a RecyclerView to display all movies**
- [X] **Use Glide to load and display movie poster images**

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [X] Improve and customize the user interface through styling and coloring
- [X] Implement orientation responsivity
    - App should neatly arrange data in both landscape and portrait mode
- [ ] Implement Glide to display placeholder graphics during loading
    - Note: this feature is difficult to capture in a GIF without throttling internet speeds.  Instead, include an additional screencap of your Glide code implementing the feature.  (<10 lines of code)

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] Eventually I would like to improve the UI to include dividers between each movie in the recyclerView

## Notes

I had a few challenges with understanding the role of fragments initially. H
However, I was able to make progress to finish the assignment and implement most stretch features.
